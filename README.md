# Succulent Watering Device

A tool that helps succulent owners water their babies properly by detecting soil moisture and using a time-based reminder sound system.

## Summary

Succulents can be difficult to keep alive especially for new owners who do not have a lot of knowledge or experience to care for succulents. As their watering needs are very different from normal plants, it can be daunting to know how to properly care for them. Our goal is to help novice succulent owners to properly care for their babies through a simple device that will remind them when it is time for their plants to be watered. 

The tool will have two key features namely: 1) LED lights will indicate the moisture level of the plants through the use of moisture sensors where it will be stuck onto the soil, 2) Sounds will remind the user when its time to water the plants and can be set on a repeated or on a scheduled time (e.g. once a week).

Through this tool, we aim to make it easier for succulent owners to take care of their plants and let it thrive and live a longer life.

## Challenges

Programming the components to work together:
1. How can we make the moisture sensor detect the moisture levels and relay the information to Arduino so that the LEDs would light up?
2. How can we integrate both sound and light system to work together?


## Timeline
What parts of the project do you anticipate you will complete in each of the next 5 weeks? Your goal is to solve the scary problems as quickly as possible!

Week 1: Concept Brainstorm, Write Proposal
Week 2: Moisture Sensors
Week 3: LED Lights
Week 4: Sound System, Build House (Extra Time)
Week 5: Present!
